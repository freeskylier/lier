### <a name="http"/> HTTP

The most common protocol used to transfer web pages and their content over
the internet. Content is sent in the clear (as plaintext), so any
[intermediary](#wiki-intermediary) could potentially read the content in
transit. HTTP is therefore not secure. [HTTPS](#wiki-https) is the secure
counterpart of HTTP.

### <a name="https"/> HTTPS

A secure version of [HTTP](#wiki-http). Content is sent encrypted to prevent
an [intermediary](#wiki-intermediary) from being able to read it in transit.

### <a name="intermediary"/> Intermediary

An entity on a computer network in between the requester of some content and
the server which hosts it, e.g. a [proxy](#wiki-proxy) or an [internet
service provider](#wiki-isp).

### <a name="isp"/> ISP

Internet service provider, the organization which connects you to the internet.
Traffic leaving your computer's local network (in your home, office, internet
cafe, etc.) goes here before being forwarded to its destination, or blocked in
the case of censorship. Traffic bound for your computer likewise has to make it
past your ISP before it can reach you.
### <a name="peer"/> Peer

Another user you're connected to on a computer network.

### <a name="p2p"/> Peer-to-Peer

...

### <a name="proxy"/> Proxy

An [intermediary](#wiki-intermediary) which forwards traffic between a user
requesting content and the server that hosts it, often because the user cannot
reach the server directly due to censorship.

### <a name="system-proxy"/> System Proxy

A program which proxies traffic for all programs on a computer which access the
network.
