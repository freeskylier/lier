# Glossary

### <a name="http"/> HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Used to transfer content such as web pages over
the internet. Content is sent unencrypted, so any
[intermediary](#wiki-intermediary) could potentially read it in
transit. HTTP is therefore not secure. [HTTPS](#wiki-https) is the secure
counterpart of HTTP.

### <a name="https"/> HTTPS

A secure version of [HTTP](#wiki-http). Content is sent encrypted to prevent
an [intermediary](#wiki-intermediary) from being able to read it in transit.

### <a name="intermediary"/> Intermediary

An entity on a computer network in between the requester of some content and
the server which hosts it, e.g. a [proxy](#wiki-proxy) or an [internet
service provider](#wiki-isp).

### <a name="isp"/> ISP

Internet service provider, an organization which provides internet access.
Traffic leaving a computer's local network (in a home, office, internet
cafe, etc.) goes here before either being forwarded to its destination, or blocked in
the case that the ISP employs censorship. Traffic bound for your computer likewise
must pass through your ISP before it can reach you.

### <a name="peer"/> Peer

Another user you're connected to on a computer network.

### <a name="peer-to-peer"/> Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

Describes a network architecture where each computer in the network can act as client and server, as opposed to just one or a few servers providing service to many clients. Peer-to-peer networks are decentralized and therefore more difficult to shut down.

### <a name="proxy"/> Proxy

An [intermediary](#wiki-intermediary) which forwards traffic between a user
requesting content and the server that hosts it, often because the user cannot
reach the server directly due to censorship.

### <a name="system-proxy"/> System Proxy

A program which proxies traffic for all programs on a computer which access the
network.
