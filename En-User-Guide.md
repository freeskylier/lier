## Installation

### Mac

Lantern is compatible with Mac OS X version 10.5 (Leopard) or higher. It's
a good idea to run the Apple Software Update app before installing Lantern to
make sure your system has all the updates available, which can include critical
stability and security updates.

After downloading Lantern, you will end up with a file that looks like
Lantern-0.XYZ.dmg. When you open this you will see a file called **Lantern
Installer**, which you can run to start the install process. If you already
have a previous version of Lantern installed on your computer, it will be
replaced with the new version. The installer will show its progress as it
copies files. When it's finished, Lantern will be started automatically and you
will be greeted with the welcome screen.


### Windows
