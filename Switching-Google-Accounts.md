'As for signing in to Lantern with a different account, you actually have to go into Settings and click Reset. That will take you back to Lantern's initial setup sequence, giving you the chance to log in with a different Google account. Note that on OS X, Lantern shares your Google login state with Safari for Lantern's login step, so if you're already signed in to Google in Safari as a different account from the one you want to use with Lantern, when you get to Lantern's sign in step, you'll already be logged in to Google as that account. But that Google page does give you the ability to sign in as a different account to use with Lantern, you just have to look for it.'
