The Proxied Sites screen is part of Get user configuration, and is available at any time by hitting the globe icon in the lower right.

This is where users in censored countries can set which sites to use Lantern as a proxy. Lantern's approach is to only proxy sites that are censored, as direct access to uncensored sites will be faster and strain the Lantern network best. The Proxied Sites screen controls what sites Lantern automatically proxies.

### Initial Configuration

Right now the initial list is just a number of commonly blocked sites. In the future we hope to build the list more dynamically based on what is actually blocked in each country. But for now we recommend adjusting it to your needs. If you just looking to explore Lantern's capabilities feel free to skip the configuration and come back later. But if you are using Lantern extensively you will likely naturally add to it - if you run across a site that seems blocked you can check if it's on the list, and add it if it's not. And as you use Lantern more we recommend removing sites that are not actually blocked, as that will help the network run more efficiently.

### Finding Sites

Before adding a new site you can check to see if it exists. This can be done by scrolling through the list, but the search box on the right lets you find things faster:

### Adding a new site

To add a site to proxy you just need to make a new line for it. You can do this anywhere you want, the very top of the list is probably the best, to remind yourself what you've added. Just hit 'enter' on the first line and then fill out your site on that line.

Be sure to hit 'update' after you've entered it, and then Lantern should start proxying it immediately.

### Removing sites

We recommend scrolling through the list and removing any sites that you know are not blocked in your country. To remove sites just select them in the text field and hit 'delete'. Be sure to hit 'update' when you're done.
