Currently installation on Linux is only available on Ubuntu. Contributions for other Linux distros and improvements to make better use of package managers are much appreciated.

The invitation to lantern has a link to an installation script. This script:

  + Downloads a .deb file.
  + Creates the uninstall script in /opt/lantern-net-installer,
  + Creates a user preferences directory (where, BTW, 'cause ~/.lantern
    doesn't seem to appear until first launch?), and
  + Does _not_ auto-launch a lantern service; 

### Uninstallation

To uninstall Lantern on Linux (help please...)

After you've run the installer the next step is to [[Setup]] Lantern.
