### Is there a risk in running Lantern? <a name="risk" />

...


### How will running Lantern affect performance on my computer? <a name="performance" />

Lantern's goal is to be as lightweight and unobtrusive as possible. In [Get
Mode](En-User-Guide#wiki-get-mode), you shouldn't even notice it's running,
outside of being able to access previously blocked sites of course. In [Give
Mode](En-User-Guide#wiki-give-mode), a portion of your internet connection may
intermittently be donated to other users, but based on the other users online
at the time, you may not even notice. Limiting the resources Lantern uses while
you're using your computer is currently a [planned
feature](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/issues/19).


### Is Lantern free? <a name="free">

Lantern is free as in money and as in freedom: free to use, modify, and
redistribute in accordance with its
[license](https://raw.github.com/getlantern/lantern/master/LICENSE). This

### How can I contribute? <a name="contributing" />

in the forums, translate documentation, submit patches, bug reports, and
