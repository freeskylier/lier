### Is there a risk in running Lantern?

...


### How will running Lantern affect performance on my computer?

Lantern's goal is to be as lightweight and unobtrusive as possible. In
[[Get Mode|En-Give-Mode-and-Get-Mode]], you shouldn't even notice it's running,
outside of being able to access previously blocked sites of course. In Give
Mode, a portion of your internet connection may intermittently be donated to
other users, but based on the other users online at the time, you may not even
notice. Limiting the resources Lantern uses while you're using your computer is
currently a [[planned
feature|https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/issues/19]].


### Is Lantern free?

Lantern is free as in money and as in freedom: free to use, modify, and
redistribute in accordance with its
[[license|https://raw.github.com/getlantern/lantern/master/LICENSE]]. This
documentation is likewise distributed under a [[free license|LICENSE.txt]].


### How can I contribute?

(run in give mode, sponsor a cloud proxy, give feedback, ask or answer questions
in the forums, add or translate documentation, submit patches, bug reports, and
feature requests, sponsor the development of a feature or bugfix)
