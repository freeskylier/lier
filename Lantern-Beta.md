## About Beta Releases
"Beta" versions of Lantern are pre-release software. They may have bugs or problems that prevent them from working properly. We make these versions available because user feedback is critical in helping us identify and fix problems before they become part of an official release. 

## Providing Feedback
If you are willing to brave the bugs and test a beta version, we hope that you will get in touch with your feedback! You can do this by:
* Filing an issue in our [public repository](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/issues/new)
* Posting on our [developer forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-devel)
* If you are a technical user or looking for a forum in a language other than English, posting on one of our [user forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-users-en). (See the message at the top for links to non-English forums.)

## About Current Versions
The current Beta Versions feature Natty, our new WebRTC-based module for NAT and Firewall traversal. We are particularly interested in feedback pertaining to: 
* General functionality – any strange behavior not present in the stable version
* Resource usage – the presence of runaway "Natty" processes
