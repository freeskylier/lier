After you've gotten [[Setup]] you're ready to start using Lantern. 

### Users Getting Access

To use Lantern simply open your favorite browser and go to a site that is on your [[Proxy Site List|Proxied Sites Configuration]] that you know is blocked. Any browser should work, as your computer itself is set up with the proxy.

If you are not able to access you might try to invite more friends in uncensored countries who would share their connection with you, or sponsor a [[cloud server|Lantern Cloud Server]] to help the lantern network. 

### All Users

#### Exploring the Lantern Network

You can explore the map of the Lantern network. The bottom of the screen shows the global statistics for everyone on the network - how many users are online now, have ever been online, and the total bandwidth transferred (currently broken). If you mouse over a country it will show you similar statistics for that country. You can also mouse over your own user and the users you're connecting to, as dots on the map.

#### Adding Friends <a name="adding-friends"/>

Building your Lantern network by adding friends is the main task for users Giving Access from open countries. Adding others in uncensored countries is key for expanding the network.

This brings up the 'Lantern Friends' screen. You can enter the email address of any friend who has a google account. Any gmail address will definitely work. If you aren't sure you can just try to add them, as many people have other email addresses set up to work with Google. Adding them will send an invitation to join Lantern, with a link to the download.

Right now there is unfortunately no feedback as to whether your invite went out or the friend successfully got online with Lantern. Adding someone will instantly put them on your list of friends, and a request goes to a moderation queue, which lets the Lantern team make sure the network doesn't break because too many users join at once. When the user successfully installs and sets up Lantern they will automatically be on your network.

We are working to improve the friending experience. If you have problems don't hesitate to get in touch through the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-users-en). And we also welcome feedback on how to make it better.

Removing people from your friend list will make it so they can not access your connection to the internet and vice versa.
