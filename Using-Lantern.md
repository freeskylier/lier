After you've gotten [[Setup]] you're ready to start using Lantern. 

### Users Getting Access

If you are in a censored region and have installed Lantern, simply open your favorite browser and navigate to any blocked site. Any browser should work, as your computer itself is set up with the proxy. If it's not working then check that the site you want is on your [[Proxy Site List|Proxied Sites Configuration]], and add it there if it's not on the list. 

If you are not able to access you might try to invite more friends in uncensored countries who would share their connection with you, or sponsor a [[cloud server|Lantern Cloud Servers]] to help the lantern network. If things still aren't working head to the [[forum|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-users-en]] and you can get assistance there.

### All Users

#### Exploring the Lantern Network

You can explore the map of the Lantern network. The bottom of the screen shows the global statistics for everyone on the network - how many users are online now, have ever been online, and the total bandwidth transferred (currently broken). If you mouse over a country it will show you similar statistics for that country. You can also mouse over your own user and the users you're connecting to, as dots on the map.

#### Adding Friends

Building your Lantern network by adding friends is the main task for users Giving Access from open countries. Adding others in uncensored countries is key for expanding the network. And any friend in a censored country that you add to your roster will instantly benefit from your connection and those of your other friends.

And it is critical for users Getting Access to invite more trusted users, to improve the network. Adding friends in uncensored countries is directly beneficial for better connections. But helping other friends within your country also helps build the Lantern network and connect you to more Lantern proxies.

This brings up the 'Lantern Friends' screen. You can enter the email address of any friend who has a google account. Any gmail address will definitely work. If you aren't sure you can just try to add them, as many people have other email addresses set up to work with Google. Adding them will send an invitation to join Lantern, with a link to the download.

Right now there is unfortunately no feedback as to whether your invite went out or the friend successfully got online with Lantern. Adding someone will instantly put them on your list of friends, and a request goes to a moderation queue, which lets the Lantern team make sure the network doesn't break because too many users join at once. When the user successfully installs and sets up Lantern they will automatically be on your network.

We are working to improve the friending experience. If you have problems don't hesitate to get in touch through the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-users-en). And we also welcome feedback on how to make it better.

Removing people from your friend list will make it so they can not access your connection to the internet and vice versa.

#### Leave Lantern Running

We encourage you to leave Lantern running, so that it can be helping others even if you are not using it right then.
