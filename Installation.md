### Downloading Lantern

Lantern is currently in a closed beta, which means that you can't download it directly from the web. Instead you need to be invited by someone. If you don't have any friends who can invite you then add your email address to the signup form at http://GetLantern.org You will be notified when we can add you to the network.

### Installing Lantern

Once you get invited you will receive an email with links to the downloaders. Pick the one appropriate for your system and then go to the corresponding page:

* [[Installation: Linux]]
