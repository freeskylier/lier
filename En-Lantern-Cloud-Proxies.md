# Lantern Cloud Proxies

If you are a Get Mode user, Lantern accesses the open internet in two ways.
First, it uses your Lantern peers who are donating their connections to proxy
your internet traffic. Second, it uses Lantern Cloud Proxies, more powerful
servers the Lantern team runs that also proxy your traffic for you.

Lantern Cloud Proxies are useful when you don't have any trusted peers online
with uncensored connections you can use. In that case, Lantern Cloud Proxies
act as a backup, available to proxy your traffic 24/7.

Lantern Cloud Proxies take the responsibility of proxying your traffic very
seriously.Lantern has an explicit interest in keeping any personally
identifiable information about the traffic routed through them secret and
ephemeral, i.e. not stored, analyzed, or shared with anyone. Any human contact
with the traffic data is limited to only the core Lantern developers and is
strictly incidental to making sure Lantern works.
