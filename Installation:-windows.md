### Supported Versions

Lantern supports Windows version XP and higher.

#### Requirements

Lantern requires Chrome to be installed. If you don't have Chrome you can get it at the [chrome download page](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/). Lantern uses Chrome to render the user interface. Future Lantern versions will automatically install it for you.

### Checking Authenticity 

Before installing, make sure that the installation file is valid by checking the signature.

Right click on the installer file and click the "Digital Signatures" tab. Under the "General" tab of the new window, click "View Certificate". Under "Details" you can verify the signature.

Each (".exe") is digitally by signed by Brave New Software Project, Inc. For June 11, 2013 to June 11, 2016, the SHA1 thumbprint should be â€Ž44:99:0c:72:fb:a0:e6:dd:f9:2a:b9:34:46:02:e7:56:00:d8:be:3c.

### Installation

![Download from E-mail](http://i.imgur.com/4vRaT68.png)

Download Lantern from your invite email. This should download a file called lantern-net-installer_windows.exe. This will be relatively small - approximately 96kb - as it fetches more needed files from the internet.

![Install from Exe](http://i.imgur.com/FTwgdMJ.png)

Double-click on the .exe file, and installation will start.

![Accept Warning](http://i.imgur.com/87YFDxG.png)

This will do several things. You will likely be prompted to allow the installer to make changes to your computer. Click yes.

Then it will detect if you have Java, and if not it should download the Java Runtime Environment from the web. Then it will download the latest Lantern code, to make sure your installation is totally up to date. If you are on a slow connection the download step may take a bit of time.

After downloading it will extract files and then startup your lantern instance.

If you see this screen you're all set. Proceed to [[Setup]].

### Stopping Lantern

We encourage you to just leave Lantern running in the background, so it can be helping censored users get access even while you're doing other tasks.

If you close the window a lantern icon will still stay in your menubar. To stop it entirely click on the lantern icon and select 'Quit Lantern'.
