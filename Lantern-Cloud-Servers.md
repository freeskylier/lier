Lantern Cloud Servers are small Amazon [EC2 instances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud) that serve as fallbacks when there are not enough peer users online. 

This ensures that people will be able to get connected, even if a friend is not online. They help make the Lantern Network much more robust.

Unfortunately these servers cost money to maintain, so Brave New Software, the organization behind Lantern, can only supply a limited number of them. If you would like to help you can soon sponsor your own Lantern Cloud Server at http://rally.org (coming soon) If you are in a censored country this provides direct access for you and your friends. And if it's a great way to give from uncensored countries, increasing the reliability of the Lantern Network.
