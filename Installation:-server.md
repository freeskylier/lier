**TODO: improve this page**

To run Lantern on a server (like EC2 or another server you have access to), you will want to run it without the user interface. 

The way to do that right now is to [build from source](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/blob/master/README.md#setting-up-a-development-environment) and run with `--disable-ui`.

TODO: how do you configure friends?
TODO: How do you run as a fallback proxy for everyone and let the lantern team know?
