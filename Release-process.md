After running through QA scripts, simply run the following for our example 0.21.3-1 release:

```
./release.bash 0.21.3-1 
```

That will create a 0.21.3-1 tag you can release from any time thereafter. To build the OSX installer for the above release, simply run:

```
./osxInstall.bash 0.21.3-1 true
``` 

You can also build an installer from the current HEAD without releasing (a throwaway installer for testing, for example) with the following:

```
./osxInstall.bash HEAD false
```

In that case you would not use release.bash.
