# Software Engineer Wanted!
The Lantern team is on the lookout for an experienced full-stack engineer who is passionate about creating and preserving an open Internet and about building tools to get around censors. Security and distributed computing experience are pluses. While we’ll seriously consider any strong coder, applicants who are fluent in JavaScript and Java will receive preference. Knowledge of Python, C, and C++ can come in handy as well.

The Lantern team also adheres to the Obama campaign’s rule of “no drama, no assholes.” We’re a small, tight-knit group of dedicated engineers who love what we do, and are kind-hearted while we’re at it. If you’re interested in joining a distributed team of non-asshole engineers working on exciting technology, please shoot us a note at jobs@getlantern.org.
