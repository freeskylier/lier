are many ways to help out, see our [['Get Involved' page|Get Involved!]].

### <a name="development"></a> Development

While Lantern is currently a small group of core developers our goal is to 
make it a truly collaborative open source project, with contributors from many 
organizations and countries.

If you aren't familiar with open source development processes we highly recommend
you read [Producing Open Source Software](http://producingoss.com/) (available for free
but don't hesitate to buy the book, it's written by a friend of Lantern). We 
try to follow the best practices it lays down, so is a great primer on how we work.

The first step is to check out our 
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
file for relevant information and then get started. We follow standard github model
of contributors submitting pull requests and then having core authors review.

We have a [development list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-devel) to 
communicate. Though the majority of our communication happens in [tickets](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/issues), feel free to 'watch' the project in 
github and you'll be notified of all we're doing. And don't hesitate to introduce yourself 
on the developers list, we can find tasks you might be interested in.

You can also sign up to help us triage issues on CodeTriage:
http://www.codetriage.com/getlantern/lantern

We have some developer documentation that is a bit hidden right now, as we are
transitioning to a better system. But if you go to the [[index|_pages]] the ones marked
[developer] will give you some information. And if you have any questions don't hesitate
to ask on the list.

Lantern decisions are made by all core developers, and we welcome anyone who contributes
sufficiently to development to become a core developer and help decide the future of Lantern.
