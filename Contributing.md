# Contributing

If you have an uncensored internet connection, you can make a difference simply by running Lantern and sharing it with those without one. Every additional user sharing her connection makes the Lantern network work that much better, and that much harder to block for censors.

There are also many other ways to contribute to Lantern:


## Communication

The Lantern community should be as open and collaborative as possible. If you have any questions, answers, or feedback that could be useful for the general community, please post in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-users-en">Lantern users forum</a>.

Any sensitive communication can be sent to the Lantern developers securely through the contact form in Lantern itself.


## Documentation

This collaboratively-maintained wiki documentation is a work in progress. If you see an area that needs more work and you would like to pitch in, we welcome your help. Just use the "New Page" or "Edit Page" buttons near the top of any wiki page.


## Translations

If you are a fluent speaker of another language and would like to conduct an official Lantern users forum in another language, or would like to help translate Lantern's UI, web site, or documentation, we would love to hear from you. Please contact us <a href="mailto:i18n@getlantern.org">here</a>.


## Development

If you are familiar with open source development processes and would like to submit an issue or a patch, that's awesome. Please see our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file and then go right ahead. Community contributors who get really involved will be welcomed as core developers.


## Sponsoring

Besides running Lantern on your own computer to share an uncensored internet connection, you can also pledge USD $10/month to sponsor a Lantern cloud proxy, which provides an additional high-capacity internet connection to the network 24 hours a day, even while your computer is off or disconnected.

Alternatively, if there is some feature or bugfix you'd like to see in the next version of Lantern, you can sponsor its development. Please <a href="mailto:sponsoring@getlantern.org">contact the Lantern developers</a> about either of these options if you would like to inquire further.

You can also just make a 1-click microdonation to the cause in general using Flattr or GitTip:

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lantern. A vibrant and active community is our reason for existing.
