# Contributing

If you have an uncensored internet connection, you can make a difference simply
by running Lantern and sharing it with those without one. Every additional user
sharing her connection makes the Lantern network work that much better, and
that much harder to block for censors.

Whether or not you have an uncensored internet connection, you can also help
by inviting people you trust to join the Lantern network. Lantern relies on
a large network of users who trust one another to share internet connections,
so the more trusted connections in the network, the better Lantern will work.

There are also many other ways to contribute to Lantern:


## <a name="communication"></a> Communication

The Lantern community should be as open and collaborative as possible. If you
have any questions, answers, or feedback that could be useful for the general
community, please post in the <a
href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-users-en">Lantern users
forum</a>.

Any sensitive communication can be sent to the Lantern developers securely
through the contact form in Lantern itself.

You can also often find members of the Lantern team in the #lantern chat room
on irc.freenode.net. An easy way to join is to go to
http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=lantern and complete the form to connect.


## <a name="documentation"></a> Documentation

This collaboratively-maintained wiki documentation is a work in progress. If
you see an area that needs more work and you would like to pitch in, we welcome
your help. Just use the "New Page" or "Edit Page" buttons near the top of any
wiki page.


## <a name="other-languages"></a> Other Languages

If you are a fluent speaker of another language and would like to help
translate Lantern's web site, documentation, or the application itself, we
would welcome your participation.

To translate the documentation in this wiki, simply click "Edit Page" near the top of any
page, add a section at the bottom for the language you'll be translating into,
and add your translations there.

For getlantern.org and Lantern itself, we use transifex.com to manage the
translation process. To help with translating these, please [create an
account](https://www.transifex.com/signin/) and send a request to join a
translation team on our project page: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/lantern/.

Lantern's official English-language public user forum is hosted at
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-users-en. Some official user forums
for other languages have been set up and linked off there, but may lack
moderators fluent in those languages. If you would like to become a moderator
for one of these forums, please email the list managers at the corresponding
address (e.g. lantern-users-fa@googlegroups.com). If you would like to start
a user forum in a new language, feel free to create one. You can then post to
the other forums announcing its availability, and links to the new forum
can be added in appropriate places.


## <a name="development"></a> Development

If you are familiar with open source development processes and would like to
submit an issue or a patch, that's awesome. Please see our
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
file for relevant information and then go right ahead. Community contributors
who get really involved will be welcomed as core developers.

You can also sign up to help us triage issues on CodeTriage:

## <a name="sponsoring"></a> Sponsoring

Besides running Lantern on your own computer to share an uncensored internet
connection, you can also pledge a one-time or monthly donation to sponsor a Lantern cloud proxy,
which provides an additional high-capacity internet connection to the network
24 hours a day, even while your computer is off or disconnected.

Alternatively, if there is some feature or bugfix you'd like to see in the next
version of Lantern, you can sponsor its development.

Please <a
href="mailto:sponsoring@getlantern.org">contact the Lantern developers</a>
about either of these options if you would like to inquire further.

You can also just make a 1-click microdonation to the cause in general using
Flattr or GitTip:

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lantern. A vibrant and active
community is vital to our existence.
