Lantern Cloud Proxies
=====================

Lantern accesses the open internet in two ways. First, it uses your Lantern peers who are donating their bandwidth and computers to proxy your internet traffic. Second, it uses Lantern Cloud Proxies -- more powerful server computers the Lantern team runs and controls that also proxy your traffic for you. 

Lantern Cloud Proxies are particularly useful when you don't have any trusted Lantern peers online for any reason. In that case, Lantern Cloud Proxies are actually necessary to get you out on the open internet -- there's really no other way to do it.

The one tricky aspect of Lantern Cloud Proxies is that you have to trust the Lantern team not to log your traffic, sell your information, or do anything else you wouldn't want us to do. While the connections to Lantern Cloud Proxies from your computer are encrypted, we have to decrypt your traffic on the proxies themselves in order to actually send them to the site you're trying to reach. We do our best not to log anything on those servers, however, and only log cases where the servers appear to be breaking, allowing us to fix them.
