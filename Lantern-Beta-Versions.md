### About Beta Software
"Beta" versions of Lantern are pre-release software. They may have bugs or problems that prevent them from working properly. We make these versions available because user feedback is critical in helping us identify and fix problems before they become part of an official release. 

### How To Provide Feedback
If you are willing to brave the bugs and test a beta version, we hope that you will get in touch with your feedback! You can do this by:
* Filing an issue in our [public repository](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/issues/new)
* Posting on our [developer forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-devel)
* If you are a non-technical user or looking for a forum in a language other than English, posting on one of our [user forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-users-en). (See the message at the top for links to non-English forums.)

### About The Current Release
The current Beta versions port Lantern to the Go programming language, significantly reducing installer size. They also introduce panning and zooming on the map as well as graphical performance improvements. Finally, this version includes new installers on all platforms.
