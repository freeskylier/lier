## Giving Access
Participating in the Lantern network in Give Access mode means that people in your Lantern network can access the internet through your computer. Your Lantern network is made up of the people you are friends with on Lantern, and their friends, branching out through 4 levels of connections.

We use the [Kaleidoscope Limited Advertisement Protocol](https://github.com/getlantern/kaleidoscope#kaleidoscope-limited-advertisement-protocol) to ensure that Lantern users only share internet connections with people they are connected to through trusted friends.

## <a name="commitment"></a>Commitment to Your Privacy and Safety

Only the core lantern developers have access to information that could identify you. Any contact they have with your data is related to making sure that Lantern is working correctly.
