Lantern's central servers store the following information: Your email address, the email address of the account that invited you, and the email addresses of anyone you invite. When you invite someone to join Lantern, they receive an email which contains the name and email address of the account you use with Lantern, and Lantern also securely transmits a Google Talk Oauth "refresh token" from your computer to a Lantern server. This allows an instance of Lantern to run under your account from the cloud, providing internet access to your trusted contacts and participating in the Lantern network even when your own computer is asleep.

Participating in the Lantern network in Give Access mode entails proxying traffic for users in your extended Lantern social network (your "trust graph"), and advertising the Lantern users you know about to other users in your social network, according to the [Kaleidoscope Limited Advertisement Protocol](https://github.com/getlantern/kaleidoscope#kaleidoscope-limited-advertisement-protocol). This allows Lantern users to share internet connections with one another only when connected on the trust graph.
