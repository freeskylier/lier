Currently, Lantern maintains a set of [cloud fallback proxy servers](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki/Lantern-Cloud-Servers) for users who aren't able to connect through a peer in their trust network, either because no such peers are online or no such peers are reachable.

In addition to helping users use Lantern to access the internet, these fallback proxies are vitally important during the installation and setup of Lantern, as they allow users to access Google Accounts and Google Talk to get onto the Lantern network in countries where these services are blocked.

At the moment, every Lantern instance is assigned to one, and only one, fallback proxy, which is set by the installer wrapper that they got in their invite e-mail.  Besides downloading and executing a Lantern installer, these wrappers create a ~/.lantern/fallback.json with the fallback proxy data.  Other proxies are possibly discoverable through the kaleidoscope network.

When a user invites another user, Lantern ensures that there is one (and only one) fallback proxy on behalf of the inviter, which is assigned to the invitee as her fallback proxy.  Future invitees of this same inviter are assigned to that same fallback proxy.  When one of these invitees invites someone else, Lantern spins up a new fallback proxy for that user, which becomes the fallback for all of her invitees, and so on.

An original rationale for this approach of spinning up fallback proxies tied to inviters was to limit the exposure of users should a fallback proxy have been compromised by the inviter.  Per aranhoide, this rationale is questionable.  aranhoide - "I used to think so; not anymore.  If a proxy is compromised N users will have degraded service.  There is some poetic justice in the fact that these will be neighbours of the infiltrator --assuming the node was discovered by infiltration-- but the damage is no more or less than if any other N users anywhere else in the trust graph were affected instead.  The constraint that we must have all proxies serve invitees of the same inviter --either directly, as currently, or transitively, as in this proposal-- only adds unwarranted difficulties to any recovery plan, IMO"

The current approach creates two problems:

1. Many proxies end up under-utilized because the corresponding inviter invites too few other Lantern users, or too few of them end up using Lantern.  This ends up wasting capacity that costs money to maintain.

2. Some proxies end up over-utilized because the sub-tree contains too many users.  This adversely impacts the user experience of users who rely on those fallback proxies.

In order to address both of these problems, we need to introduce some sort of load balancing that allows us to:

1. Allow a single fallback proxy to serve the invitees of multiple inviters

2. Use multiple fallback proxies to serve the invitees of a single inviter

## Solution for Problem 1 - Expanded inviter tree for a single proxy

I'll let aranhoide expand on this, but the basic idea is that when a user with no associated fallback proxy invites another user, rather than spinning up a new proxy, we search the inviter's trust graph to find the nearest user with an available fallback proxy and use this for the invitee.

## Solution for Problem 2 - Multiple Fallback Proxies per Inviter

Currently, fallback proxies are assigned to users during the invitation process.  This is necessary because it allows us to provide customized installers that contain the correct fallback proxy and allow Lantern users to get online via that fallback proxy in case Google Accounts and/or Google Talk are blocked in their country.

Unfortunately, the invitation process does not give us a good mechanism to load balance amongst fallback proxies because we don't know how heavily utilized a fallback proxy is until someone actually installs Lantern and starts using it.  In the most extreme case, one can imagine that a very lightly utilized fallback ends up getting included in a large number of invitations.  If all, or many, of these invitations get accepted and these users end up actively using Lantern, their fallback proxy will end up over-utilized.

This means that we need a mechanism for re-balancing after invitations have already gone out.  There are a few different approaches available:

### Approach A: Kaleidoscope

Kaleidoscope already provides us with a mechanism for using trust relationships between peers to connect to peer proxies.  From the perspective of a Give mode user, every proxy that runs under a trusted identity is made available for proxying and the Lantern client already load balances amongst these.  Fallback proxies are in fact just Lantern instances, so perhaps we can leverage Kaleidoscope to make them discoverable to Give mode users.

The basic idea would be that when we create the install wrapper, in addition to adding the fallback proxy's ip address to the Lantern client's list of fallbacks, we also permanently add that Proxy's XMPP identity to the client's roster.

The client would use the fallback IP only if it doesn't know about any other proxies (fallback or peer).  Once the client learns about the proxy instance via KScope, the client would start using that instead.  If the fallback gets overloaded, we can spool up additional instances under the same XMPP identity, which will become available to the client via KScope.  The client will automatically load balance amongst these instances.

### Approach B: Controller-based fallback reassignment

1. Currently, LanternUser keeps track of an installerLocation corresponding to a custom installer that encapsulates the fallback proxy that will be used by that user's invitees.  Let's change this to be a List of installerLocations that can keep track of new installers as we add them.

2. When sending out an invitation from an existing user with an existing fallback proxy, use the most recent installerLocation from the list (as opposed to just the single installerLocation like we do today).

3. Have fallback proxies track and report the maximum # of distinct clients that have connected to that proxy via Librato (already implemented).

4. Implement a batch job in the controller that monitors all fallback proxies for activity using the metric from #3.  If a fallback proxy gets too busy (i.e. # of distinct clients exceeds threshold):

   1. Spin up a new fallback proxy for LanternUser who owns it

   2. Randomly reassign N LanternUsers in the sub-tree to the new fallback proxy, where N = max distinct clients - threshold (this probably requires us to add a property to LanternUser that tracks the fallback proxy that they're using (as opposed to the one their invitees will use).

5. Implement a protocol between Lantern instances and the controller (probably on the XMPP channel) that tells Lantern instances which fallback proxy they should be using.

6. In the Lantern client, if the client is told to use a different fallback proxy than the one currently in use, switch to the new fallback proxy and save this in .lantern for future startups.  The old one should no longer be used at this point.
