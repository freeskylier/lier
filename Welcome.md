Welcome to the Lantern Documentation

Thanks for checking out Lantern. We're still in 'beta' mode, so please don't hesitate to give feedback and get direct help on the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-users-en). The documentation is a work in progress, so if we leave anything out just ask! And if you're interested in helping us make Lantern better there are lots of ways, see [[Get Involved]].

To get started with Lantern see [[Installation]].

Or if you've already got it installed jump straight to [[Setup]], or if you've got it all configured but aren't sure what to do next see [[Using Lantern]]

For common questions see [[Questions and Answers]]. We'll be expanding it as we get more questions on the forum. You also may be interested in how Lantern approaches [[Privacy]].
