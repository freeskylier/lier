Occasionally the core Lantern developers will request for you to email
them your logs to better diagnose an issue.

To do this you need to find the logs directory on your platform:

##### Windows Vista/7/8

`C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Lantern\logs`

##### Windows XP

`C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Lantern\Logs`

##### OSX 

`~/Library/Logs/Lantern`

##### Ubuntu 

`~/.lantern/logs`

The directory should have files in it like `lantern.log`, `lantern.log.1`, etc. Zip up the whole directory into a single zip file. Sometimes it may only contain `lantern.log`, which is the most recent log file. You can zip it to be smaller, or just send it as is.

Attach the zip or the log file to an email sent to team@getlantern.org. Let us know if you would like to use pgp to encrypt your email and we can provide our public key.
