### Supported Versions

Lantern supports OS/X version 10.6 and higher.

### Installation

(screenshot of clicking on OS/X link of invite email)

Download Lantern from your invite email. This should download a file called lantern-net-installer_mac_os_0_0_1.dmg. This will be relatively small - approximately 1.5mb - as it fetches more needed files from the internet.

Double-click on the .dmg file, and then double-click on the 'Lantern Installer' icon.

This will do several things. It will detect if you have Java, and if not it will download it from the web. Then it will download the latest Lantern code, to make sure your installation is totally up to date. If you are on a slow connection the download step may take a bit of time.

Next you will get a prompt about 'install4g'. Install4g is a program we use to make the Lantern install experience smoother across all platforms, so just enter your password, as that is Lantern getting permission to install itself and to make changes to your proxy settings so your connection can be shared.

This should extract files and then startup your lantern instance.
