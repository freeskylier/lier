As with any open source project, Lantern will only be truly successfully if _you_ help out. 
Right now we're in a 'beta' state, with tons to do before we spread it to the world. 
And most of the tasks we need help on require no programming knowledge. Developers
are of course more than welcome, but this page is for everyone else to find a way to
help make Lantern great.

### <a name="use-lantern"></a>Use and Spread Lantern

If you have an uncensored internet connection, you can make a difference simply
by keeping Lantern running. Every additional user sharing her connection makes 
the Lantern network work that much better, and that much harder to block for censors.

Whether or not you have an uncensored internet connection, you can also help
by inviting people you trust to join the Lantern network. Lantern relies on
a large network of users who trust one another to share internet connections,
so the more trusted connections in the network, the better Lantern will work. So if
you are an early user please spread Lantern among your trusted friends to help
the network grow.


### Report Problems

At the current 'beta' stage of development one of the most valuable things you can do is 
report to us if it is _not_ working for you. The ideal way to do this is on 
the [users forum](https://groups.google.com/group/lantern-users-en). If you 
don't feel comfortable with your name in public feel free to use dummy 
account / name. You can also use the 'contact' form from Lantern itself
to send a message privately to the core developers.

![contact](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s209/sh/b0ebafae-f50e-41e7-b003-11299102d348/feefe49505573ab528410b708e48b0e1/deep/0/Lantern%20and%20Welcome%20to%20Mail.png)

The most important thing to let us know is if you are in a censored country and are
unable to connect at all. But feel free to report more minor errors, and also 
to make suggestions about ways that Lantern could work better for you. Try to
give as much detail as possible. See this [how to report bugs 
effectively](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html) for general 
guidelines. For Lantern be sure to include your operating system, where you are, and
if you are in 'give' or 'get' mode (all users in censored countries are automatically
in 'get'), and what version of Lantern you're running.

The above is 1.0.0-beta2, you should see some number there.

You also may be asked to email your logs for the developers to diagnose. See
[[Emailing Lantern Logs]] for more information.


### <a name="other-languages"></a> Translate Lantern

If you are a fluent speaker of another language and would like to help
translate Lantern's web site, documentation, or the application itself, we
would welcome your participation.

See [[Translating Lantern]] for more information.

### Promote Lantern

We also welcome people who are interested in helping spread the word about Lantern. We
are mostly software developers, but unlike most developers our software will only work
if lots of people in uncensored countries run it. So we welcome ideas and actions to 
get more and more people to run Lantern. Social media campaigns, magazine articles, blog
posts, videos, kickstarter, etc. - if you've got experience promoting great stuff then get in touch.
And no idea is too big or too small. For right now just introduce yourself on the [users 
forum](https://groups.google.com/group/lantern-users-en). If we get enough people there 
we will start a dedicated forum.

### <a name="documentation"></a> Help with documentation

This collaboratively-maintained wiki documentation is a work in progress. If
you see an area that needs more work and you would like to pitch in, we welcome
your help. Right now you needed to be added to the Documentation Team to edit, 
just let us know of your interest on the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lantern-users-en). 
Then to edit just use the "New Page" or "Edit Page" buttons near the top of any
wiki page.

### <a name="development"></a> Develop 

If you are a developer and are interested in helping build Lantern see the [[Contributing]] page.

### <a name="donating"></a> Donate

Lantern also welcomes donations through our [Rally page](https://rally.org/getlantern) You can pledge a one-time or monthly donation to sponsor a Lantern cloud proxy,
which provides an additional high-capacity internet connection to the network
24 hours a day.

Alternatively, if there is some feature or bugfix you'd like to see in the next
version of Lantern, you can sponsor its development.

Please <a
href="mailto:sponsoring@getlantern.org">contact the Lantern developers</a>
about either of these options if you would like to inquire further.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lantern. A vibrant and active
community is vital to our existence.
