Lantern depends on a strong trust network of users that spans the censorship divide and that includes enough Give mode users to have proxies available when censored users need them.

To this end, both Give and Get mode users need tools to help them grow their trust networks.  The benefits of growing the Lantern trust network aren't immediately palpable to users.  It may take Give mode users a while before they see any Get mode users connecting through their proxy. Due to the immediate availability of fallback proxies, Get mode users may not sense the importance of building their trust network in order to improve the speed and reliability of the Lantern proxy network.

Given these challenges, Lantern needs to both make it as easy as possible to grow one's trust network, as well as provide education and encouragement to get users to engage in this process.

The tools for growing ones network are universally applicable, while the education and encouragement need to differ between the Give and the Get mode experiences.  This document outlines approaches for addressing all of these aspects of building the trust network.

### Tools
